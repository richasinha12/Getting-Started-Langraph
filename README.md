# Getting-Started-Langraph
Conversational AI Chatbot Using LangGraph  Developed a chatbot with LangGraph, managing conversational flows via a state graph and integrated Groq's Gemma2-9b-It language model for real-time, context-aware responses. Utilized LangSmith for debugging and tracing, and visualized workflows with Mermaid diagrams for enhanced system clarity.
