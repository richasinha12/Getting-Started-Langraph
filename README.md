# Getting-Started-Langraph
Conversational AI Chatbot Using LangGraph  Developed a chatbot with LangGraph, managing conversational flows via a state graph and integrated Groq's Gemma2-9b-It language model for real-time, context-aware responses. Utilized LangSmith for debugging and tracing, and visualized workflows with Mermaid diagrams for enhanced system clarity. 
Demonstrated scalability for applications in customer support and interactive assistants.



Description of Code
The provided code demonstrates the creation of a conversational chatbot using LangGraph, LangChain, and Groq's Gemma2-9b-It language model. It builds a state-based graph system to handle user interactions and manage conversational flows effectively. The key components include:

Integration with LLM: Groq's Gemma2-9b-It language model powers the chatbot, ensuring intelligent and context-aware responses.
StateGraph Design: LangGraph's StateGraph is used to structure the conversational flow, making the chatbot's logic modular and extensible.
User Input Handling: A loop enables real-time user input and bot responses until the user exits.
Purpose of the Code
The purpose of this code is to:

Simplify the creation of intelligent chatbots using modular state-graph designs.
Leverage modern LLMs for building scalable, customizable chat solutions.
Enable developers to visualize and debug chatbot workflows effectively with tools like Mermaid diagrams.
